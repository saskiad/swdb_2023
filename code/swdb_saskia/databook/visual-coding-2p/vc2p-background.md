# Visual Coding 2-photon

The Visual Coding 2-photon dataset is a survey of in vivo physiological activity in the awake mouse cortex. Neural activity was recorded using {term}`Two photon calcium imaging`. We used transgenic tools to target the expression of a fluorescent calcium indicator, {term}`GCaMP`6, to a specific population of neurons. We collected data across six different visual cortical areas, including {term}`V1` and five {term}`HVA`s, using 14 transgenic lines, and across the cortical layers. 

During imaging, mice were awake, head-fixed under the microscope, and positioned on a running disk that enabled them to run at will. The mice passively viewed an assortment of visual stimuli [visual stimuli](vc2p-stimuli.md) presented on a monitor. Cameras recorded the eye position of the eye pointed at the monitor. Thus, in addition to the neural activity, we also have measured the mouse's running activity, and the pupil position, and pupil area of the mouse's eye. 

## Background
There is a long history of studying the activity of neurons in the visual system. Some of the earliest work stems from classic experiments of David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel who had developed the tungsten electrode. Inserting the electrode in the V1 of an anasethized cat, they were able to map the <b>receptive field</b> of the neuron, the spatio-temporal feature that best drives that neuron.

Over the last sixty years, extensive work has been done using this approach, recording from single or small groups of neurons in V1 as well as other regions of the visual system, characterizing the features that best drive neurons. ...
