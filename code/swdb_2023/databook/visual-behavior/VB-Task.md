## Behavior Training Stages

Mice learned the change detection task through a series of training stages, with transitions between stages determined by specific advancement criteria. First, mice learned to detect changes in the orientation of full field static grating stimuli. Next, a 500ms inter stimulus interval period with mean luminance gray screen was added between the 250ms stimulus presentations, incorporating a short-term memory component to the task. Once mice successfully and consistently performed orientation change detection with flashed gratings, they moved to the image change detection version of the task. During image change detection, 8 natural scene images were presented during each behavioral session, for a total of 64 possible image transitions. When behavioral performance again reached criterion (d-prime >1 for 2 out of 3 consecutive days), mice were transitioned to the 2-photon imaging or Neuropixels recording stage in which they performed the task during simultaneous measurement of neural activity and behavior.

During recording sessions (but not during training), stimulus presentations are randomly omitted with a 5% probability, resulting in an extended gray screen period between two presentations of the same stimulus and disrupting the expected cadence of stimulus presentations. The change and pre-change stimulus presentations are never omitted.

Running speed, licking, and reward delivery are measured during all behavior sessions. Pupil diameter and eye position are only measured during 2-photon or Neuropixels recording sessions.
